      <p class="lead mb-3">
        This web application is the user-facing end of a project created by myself, aimed at giving newer developers a
        learning experience about some of the processes and conventions they may encounter at their first companies
        while not being too overwhelming in its source code. It's meant to be somewhat opinionated about style, testing,
        and developer workflow, focusing on simple concepts and top-notch execution over any single triumphant "idea for
        an app".
      </p>
      <p class="lead mb-3">
        Developers that contribute to this project are exposed to several key concepts in preparation for professional
        onboarding. They will attribute development time to stories, follow foundational Git practices, write quality
        code and accompanying tests, elicit peer review, shepherd their code all the way through CI-CD, and treat the
        application as a first-class product. As an additional benefit of their participation, developers will be able
        to contribute personal single-page application snippets that showcase their talents while also demonstrating
        their adherence to team development and stewardship of a high-quality code base.

          The client side runs on Vue.js 3. It utilizes Vuex for state management and Vue Router for navigation. The
          usage of Vue is a reflection of my recently discovered love of the framework itself. Having mainly been a back
          end engineer since I began, I needed an approachable solution for the front end. Vue has given me just that.

          The server side is Rails version 7 running in API mode with a Postgres database and a Sidekiq sidecar for
          asynchronous tasks. It uses a service object interactor pattern and employs some basic authentication with
          Bcrypt. It is hosted on Railway.com at
